## Replication of "How intermittent breaks in interaction improve collective intelligence" by Ethan Bernsteina, Jesse Shoreb, and David Lazerc

I use the [replicaiton code]() from the Harvard Dataverse to replicate the paper [How intermittent breaks in interaction improve collective intelligence]().

In this paper, the authors explore how people affect each other when solving problems. Specifically, they analyze the effects of timing on social influence. They examine social treatment that is constant, intermittent, or non-existant, and demonstrate that intermittent social influence provides the benefits of constant social influence without the costs associated with it.
